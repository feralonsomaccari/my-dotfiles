## TODO

List of stuff I'd like to eventually do in NVIM. Scratched means that I was able to configure it

1) ~~Update highlight color on neotree, is hard to see~~
2) Fix navigation inside wkdflow plugin
3) ~~Navigation in cmp using ctrl+j and k~~
4) ~~Keep showing current buffer file in status line even if we are focusing neo tree (is getting invisible when using neotree)~~
5) ~~Remove auto adding comment when pressing enter after a commented line~~
6) If I do :w in neotree should save current buffer instead of trying to save the tree
7) ~~Show number line in the current line I am~~
8) ~~Find a propper keybinding for closing current buffer~~
9) ~~Add color to file name in the end of the path in lualine for easy reading~~
10) If "/" doenst find anything then avoid throwing error in messages (this blocks the flow)
11) ~~Set up a key map to jump to file preview in Telescope~~
12) ~~Add jira-cli support~~
13) ~~Be able to use ctrl+j and ctrl+k inside telescope for quick navigation~~
